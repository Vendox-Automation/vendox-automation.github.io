## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

Here is a checklist for the team to run the website locally:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- Open a terminal and check if it's installed by running: `node -v`

### 2. Clone or Pull the Repository
Make sure you have the latest version of the code:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Run this command in the project root folder to install all required libraries:
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
Start the local server with:
```bash
npm run serve
```

### 5. Open in Browser
Once the server starts, open your browser and go to:
👉 **http://localhost:9000**

Changes you make to the code will automatically reload the page.
